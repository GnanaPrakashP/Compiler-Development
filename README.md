# Compiler-Development
I have developed a compiler for a language similar to C programming language. This compiler supports recursive functions, structures, classes and objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

An informal specification of the source programming language - https://silcnitc.github.io/expl.html

The specification for an extension of the primary source language with support for object-oriented programming - https://silcnitc.github.io/oexpl-specification.html

This project is made into two parts,<br/>
Part 1 supports functions, structures, classes, and objects.<br/>
Part 2 supports inheritance and polymorphism.

Overview of the project<br/>
